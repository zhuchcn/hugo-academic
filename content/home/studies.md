1. Fast Food Study
A ramdomized, cross-over dietary intervention study looking at the different effect of a high satuate diet (fast food) and a high unsatuated and a high fiber diet (Mediterranean diet) to HDL composition (lipidome and glycoproteome) and function, as well as host metabolome and gut microbiome. Manuscript under written to J Lipid Res and Am J Gastroenterol.

2. Egg Study
A ramdomized, cross-over dietary intervention study looking at effect of 2 eggs per day vs yolk-free substitute to HDL composition (lipidome and glycoproteome) and function, as well as host metabolome and gut microbiome. Manuscript under written to Am J Clinical Nur.

3. Alzheimer Study
A pilot study compares the site-specific glycosylation of plasma HDL-associated proteins including ApoE, ApoCIII, A1AT and Fetuin, in Alzheimer desease patients.

4. Ghana Study
A ramdomized controlled study looking at iLNS (lipid based nutrient supplement) to infant HDL composition and function and the relationship to growth. This is a subset of a large trail of 1320 infant-mother pairs done in Ghana.

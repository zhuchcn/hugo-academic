abstract = "Multiple methods are used to separate high density lipoprotein (HDL) from plasma, including an array of density-based ultracentrifugation methods, as well as dextran sulfate separation. Ultracentrifugation is the gold standard for lipoprotein isolation and has been used to assess HDL for decades. However, it is thought that the high sheer stress and high salt concentrations in density ultracentrifugation based methods may lead to the loss of specific molecular species in HDL. Moreover, none of the current methods have been optimized and validated for subsequent omic anaylsis. In this study, several HDL separation methods were optimized and validated, including multiple sequential flotation and gradient ultracentrifugation methods, and the dextran sulfate precipitation method. These methods were compared using a standard pooled HDL sample and analyses were completed in triplicate. Lipidomic, proteomic, and glycomic analyses were performed on the separated HDL using mass spectrometry. Our results show that there were differences between methods in the proteome, lipidome, and glycome of HDL indicating that the specific HDL isolation protocol influences the compositional analysis of HDL."

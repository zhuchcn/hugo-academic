abstract = "Abstract β-Cryptoxanthin, a carotenoid found in fruits and vegetables such as tangerines, red peppers, and pumpkin, has several functions important for human health. Most evidence from observational, in vitro, animal model, and human studies suggests that β-cryptoxanthin has relatively high bioavailability from its common food sources, to the extent that some β-cryptoxanthin–rich foods might be equivalent to β-carotene–rich foods as sources of retinol. β-Cryptoxanthin is an antioxidant in vitro and appears to be associated with decreased risk of some cancers and degenerative diseases. In addition, many in vitro, animal model, and human studies suggest that β-cryptoxanthin–rich foods may have an anabolic effect on bone and, thus, may help delay osteoporosis."

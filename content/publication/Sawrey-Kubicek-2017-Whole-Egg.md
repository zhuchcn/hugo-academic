abstract = "Despite recent changes in the US Dietary Guidelines indicating that dietary cholesterol is no longer a nutrient to be limited, the question of whether eggs should be part of a healthy diet remains controversial, particularly in populations at increased risk for cardiovascular disease. To address this question, a randomized, single-blinded, crossover trial was conducted in 20 overweight and obese (BMI 25–35 kg/m2) postmenopausal women to compare the effects of whole eggs (equivalent to 2 large eggs/day) vs. egg whites in a breakfast meal on lipoprotein profiles. After a 2-week lead-in period all women consumed breakfast meals containing whole eggs and egg whites for 4 weeks each, in randomized order (10 starting with whole eggs, 10 starting with egg whites), with a 4-week washout period between the two arms. Fasting blood samples and 4-day diet records were collected at the beginning and end of each intervention period. Consumption of whole eggs was associated with a larger change from baseline (change in the egg arm minus the change in egg white arm) in the intake of dietary cholesterol, mean±SE: (394.9±13.7 mg), total fat (8.2±2.1%), and saturated fat (2.9±0.9%). Analysis of variance showed that HDL-C increased significantly more during whole egg vs. egg white consumption (1.2±1.3 mg/dl vs. −1.6±1.4 mg/dl, p<0.05) whereas total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C did not change significantly. Six women, classified as dietary cholesterol hyper-responders due to an HDL-C increase in the upper quartile (ΔHDL-C ≥9 mg/dl), had higher baseline total cholesterol (240.2±10.2 mg/dl vs. 207±8.1 mg/dl, p=0.02) and LDL-cholesterol (156.3±8.9 mg/dl vs. 128.4±6.3 mg/dl, p=0.02) than hypo-responders. The hyper-responders also differed from hypo-responders in baseline dietary cholesterol intake (184.2±20.3 mg/dl vs. 108.2±13.4 mg/dl, p=0.03), but did not differ in any other baseline dietary measurements or any baseline anthropometric measures including BMI, waist and hip circumference. The results of this study show that egg consumption is accompanied by a modest increase in HDL-C in overweight/obese postmenopausal women without significant increases in TC or LDL-C."

abstract = "HDL (high density lipoprotein) is the key mediator in reverse cholesterol transport. Recent research has also shown that it plays a role in immune modulation. Diet has a significant impact on the HDL lipidome, which is associated with HDL’s function. In this present study, we examined the effects of two common diets, the fast food (FF) diet and the Mediterranean (Med) diet, on the HDL lipidome. Five male and five female (n=10) were recruited to participate in a randomized order cross-over study. Subjects were healthy, non-smokers, age 18–65, BMI 18.5–25. Each subject was randomized to consume either the Med or FF diet for 4 days in the first treatment period, followed by a 7-day wash-out, followed by the other diet for 4 days in the second treatment period. All food was provided to the subjects during the Med diet, and during the FF diet period subjects were given gift cards to purchase specific meals at fast food restaurants. Fasting blood draw was taken before and after each dietary intervention. HDL was isolated using a density-based sequential ultra centrifugation method, using density 1.63 – 1.21 g/ml. HDL was then extracted using an MTBE-methanol method and injected into a LC-QTOF for lipidomic analysis. Feature annotation was done using MS-DIAL. Quantification was done using lipid class-specific standard curves. HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was measured using a commercial kit with THP monocytes transformed to macrophages. The Med diet and FF diet differentially altered the HDL lipidome. The FF diet increased lysophospholipids and triglycerides, and fatty acid saturation, while more unsaturated lipids were observed after the Med diet. These change in the HDL lipidome were correlated with cholesterol efflux capacity."
